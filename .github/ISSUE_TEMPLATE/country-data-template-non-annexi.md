# \<Country\> (\<ISO3\>)
Here we list all UNFCCC submissions and other official data sources for <Country>.

## UNFCCC submissions
List submissions with status. Data can be found in the `downloaded_data/UNFCCC/\<country\>` folder.

Status can be
* **unchecked**: submission not yet checked
* **low/medium/high priority**: submissions checked. Data to be read with given priority
* **read**:  data has been read
* **no data**: there is no data in the submission

Each entry has the following form

* \<submission\>, \<terminology\>, \<status\>, \<link to issue\>
text describing the data

e.g.
* NC1, IPCC2006, high priority, #XXXYYY
Detailed data for 2015, less data for other years but main sectors present.

The terminology is important as data in IPCC2006 categories has priority as it will currently not be made available through the UNFCCC interface.

### National communications (NC)

### Biannial Update Reports (BUR)

### Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC)
